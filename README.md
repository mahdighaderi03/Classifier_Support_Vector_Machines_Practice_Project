# Classifier_Support_Vector_Machines_Practice_Project
This notebook focuses on harnessing the power of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to construct and train a robust predictive model. Our objective is to analyze human cell records and employ SVM to categorize these cells into either benign or malignant classes.
