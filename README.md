# Classifier_Support_Vector_Machines_Practice_Project
This notebook focuses on harnessing the power of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to construct and train a robust predictive model. Our objective is to analyze human cell records and employ SVM to categorize these cells into either benign or malignant classes.
SVM operates by transforming data into a higher-dimensional feature space, enabling the classification of data points that may not exhibit linear separability otherwise. It seeks to discover a boundary or separator between different categories and then projects the data in a manner that this separator can be visualized as a hyperplane. This transformation allows us to predict the classification of new data by assessing its attributes in relation to this hyperplane.
